  abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best
	described as networks with complex topology. A common property of
	many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free
	power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence
	of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the
	addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially
	to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these
	two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions,
	which indicates that the development of large networks is governed
	by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars
	of the individual systems.},

  abstract = { In this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic
	agents with fixed and switching topologies. We analyze three cases:
	1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with
	switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication
	time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols
	for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence
	analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between
	the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network
	and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus
	protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic
	connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that
	balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus
	problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis
	of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function
	for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement
	function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement
	dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive
	feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks
	with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that
	rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory.
	Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our
	theoretical results.},

	is possible for strong enough coupling. The converse is also true

  abstract = {This paper investigates synchronization dynamics of a general model
	of complex delayed networks as well as the effects of time delays.
	Some simple yet generic criteria ensuring delay-independent and delay-dependent
	synchronization are derived, which are less conservative than those
	reported so far in the literature. Moreover, a scale "nu" denoted
	by a function of the smallest and the second largest eigenvalues
	of coupling matrix is presented to analyze the effects of time delays
	on synchronization of the networks. Furthermore, various kinds of
	coupling schemes, including small-world networks and scale-free networks,
	are studied. It is shown that, if the coupling delays are less than
	a positive threshold, then the network will be synchronized. On the
	other hand, with the increase of the coupling delays, the synchronizability
	of the network will be restrained and even eventually desynchronized.
	The results are illustrated by a prototype composed of the chaotic
	Duffing oscillators. Numerical simulations are also given to verify
	theoretical results},
