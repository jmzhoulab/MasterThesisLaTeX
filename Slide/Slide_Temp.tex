        \frametitle{What is Complex Network?}

            In the context of network theory, a complex network is a network (graph) with non-trivial topological features―features that do not occur in simple networks such as lattices or random graphs but often occur in complete graphs. The study of complex networks is a young and active area of scientific research inspired largely by the empirical study of real-world networks such as computer networks and social networks.\\

            Two well-known and much studied classes of complex networks are scale-free networks and small-world networks, whose discovery and definition are case-studies in the field.

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{scale-free networks}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Scale-free networks show a power law degree distribution like many real networks.
          \item rich get richer
          \item The mechanism of preferential attachment has been proposed as a mechanism to explain power law degree distributions in some networks.
        \end{itemize}

                &+ \sum_{j=1,i \neq j}^N b_{ij}(r_{b_{ij}}(t))\Sigma (x_j(t-\tau_c(t))-x_i(t-\tau_c(t)))+u_i(t)\Bigr\}dt\notag\\

    \end{align}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{small-world networks}
        Small-world networks tend to contain neighborhood, and near-neighborhood, meaning sub-networks which have connections between almost any two nodes within them. This follows from the defining property of a high cluster coefficient.  Most pairs of nodes will be connected by at least one short path.
        \end{frame}

    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}
      Both are characterized by specific structural features―power-law degree distributions for the former and short path lengths and high clustering for the latter. However, as the study of complex networks has continued to grow in importance and popularity, many other aspects of network structure have attracted attention as well.

        \frametitle{What is Synchronization?}
        The origin of the word synchronization is a Greek root ($\sigma\upsilon\gamma$ $\chi\rho o \nu o\varsigma$ which means “to share the common time”). The original meaning of synchronization has been maintained up to now in the colloquial use of this word, as agreement or correlation in time of different processes.
        \begin{definition}
            In mathematics, \alert{synchronization} can be defined as a process wherein two (or many) dynamical systems adjust a given property of their motion to a common behavior as time goes to infinity, due to coupling or forcing.
        \end{definition}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Synchronization Patterns}
       Many different synchronization states have been studied in the past 10 years, for example complete synchronization, phase synchronization, lag  synchronization, generalized synchronization, imperfect phase synchronization, and almost synchronization and cluster synchronization.
    \end{frame}




\subsection{Cluster Synchronization}
    \begin{frame}{What is Cluster Synchronization?}
        \begin{definition}
          \alert{cluster synchronization} is observed when the dynamical nodes synchronize each other in each group (formed by certain partition rules), but no synchronization appears between any two different groups.
        \end{definition}

        Cluster Synchronization was the first discovered and is the simplest form of synchronization in chaotic systems. It consists in a perfect hooking of the chaotic trajectories of two systems which is achieved by means of a coupling signal, in such a way that they remain in step with each other in the course of the time.
